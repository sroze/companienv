But if you do this... in development the plugin won't run either, right? ðŸ¤”

Of course !
I must check if the file exist.

But I don't like the name of this option, do you have any suggestion?

`ignore-dist-file-if-not-exist`?! :smile:

Let's rewind. Why don't you want the plugin to run in production? Because AFAIK, you will load the `.env` file only if your environment variables are not already defined, right? For example, Symfony will not load the `.env` file if the `APP_ENV` environment variable is already defined.

So you prefer I use an equivalent like Symfony?
I remove option and use only anything like `$_SERVER['APP_ENV']`.

For me your idea is clearly better, more simple and logic.

What I meant was... why do you care if this script is run when your application won't use the `.env` file that was generated? ðŸ¤”
